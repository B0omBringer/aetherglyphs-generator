# What is this?
This is a pair of Python scripts for generating Aetherglyph text for use in two different games - Project Arrhythmia (aetherglyphs-pa.py) and Soundodger 2 (aetherglyphs.py). 
Aetherglyphs are a recurring element in the lore for the album Aetherborne by Chime.
# How to use
- Run the file of your choice in a Python interpreter.
- Enter the text you want in Aetherglyphs.
- Copy the result and paste it into a text object ingame.
